# Our Mission

Biomechanics is the study of movement, forces, and structure of living creatures. Researchers who study biomechanics push forward our knowledge in spaces such as medicine, visual media, and sports. The Biomechanics Foundation is committed to facilitating continued growth and development of the biomechanics research community through a few key areas:

## Software

We build tools to help biomechanists achieve the goals and acquire the knowledge they pursue. This includes making current practices faster and more user-friendly as well as offering new possibilities to push the boundaries of the study. As we minimize the mundane and expand the realm of feasibility, we are excited for all kinds of users to ask bigger questions.

## Education

It is equally important for biomechanists to know how to make the most of their tools. To help users do their best work, we will share the most up-to-date best practices for collecting, processing, and analyzing data alongside providing justification for relevant software design decisions. By bringing publications and real-world use together, we aim to close the knowledge gap between cutting-edge research and current practice.

## Outreach

We believe in our mission, and we believe in sharing it with a broad community. Strong outreach is necessary for keeping up with the latest practices in both the clinic and research, and we aim to connect these spaces through sharing knowledge to accomplish what is otherwise impossible. Our outreach must also extend beyond biomechanists. Our position brings insight that we can share with manufacturers of measurement tools of the field to better serve the biomechanics community, and we can distill our knowledge of biomechanics for the general public to raise awareness for treatments and ways to improve quality of life.
